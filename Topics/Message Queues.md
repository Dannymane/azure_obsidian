# [Message Queues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-azure-and-service-bus-queues-compared-contrasted)

## Use Cases

### Storage Queues

- **Large Message Storage**: Suitable for storing over 80 gigabytes of messages in a queue.
- **Progress Tracking**: Useful for tracking progress for processing a message, especially if a worker crashes.
- **Server-Side Logs**: If you require server-side logs of all transactions executed against your queues.
- **Large Queue Size**: If you need queues that can be larger than 80 GB in size.

### Service Bus Queues

- **Real-Time Messaging**: When your solution needs to receive messages without polling the queue.
- **Ordered Delivery**: If your solution requires guaranteed first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordered delivery.
- **Duplicate Detection**: When you want automatic duplicate detection.
- **Transactional Behavior**: If your solution requires transactional behavior and atomicity when sending or receiving multiple messages.
- **Role-Based Access**: If you need a role-based access model to the queues with different rights/permissions for senders and receivers.
- **Processing Messages as Parallel Long-Running Streams**: When your application processes messages as parallel streams using the **session ID**, allowing consuming nodes to compete for streams and examine the application stream state with transactions.
- **Larger message size**: 64-256KB.
- **Advanced Features**: If you're building a hybrid application or require advanced features like sessions, transactions, duplicate detection, automatic dead-lettering, and durable publish and subscribe capabilities.

Storage Queues are generally more suitable for basic communication and large storage needs, while Service Bus Queues offer more advanced features and real-time capabilities.

## Comparison

Azure Service Bus supports "Receive and Delete" mode, where messages are immediately consumed and removed from the queue.  
Messages in Event Hubs are retained for a configured retention period, and consumers are responsible for tracking their position in the stream.  
In Queue Storage messages are hidden for a specified visibility timeout period, and if not deleted within that time, they become visible again.
